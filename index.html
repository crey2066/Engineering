        During my first week of engineering I had a lot of fun. I learned how to create my own website as well as many different coding options to specialize it. We did a team bonding activity where a few kids out of a group of about 20 had pipes and we all had to figure out how to work together to lead a marble through the pipes and into a bucket.

        As of my second week of engineering, I have learned plenty of safety precautions and the proper gear to be wearing when engineering. I've also learned about the website tinkercad and started a design on a Rube Goldberg machine. Our weekly challenge was to create an everyday household item on tinkercad using only basic shapes. I decided to do a vacuum cleaner and it turned out extremely well. I've made a few friends in this class and I enjoy the teaching style of my teacher. I can't wait to start building and designing actual projects.

        For my third week of this class, we worked on developing our project and actually started to lay the foundation down on it. My group has finished most of the building of the design but there are still a few things required to be fully completed with the project. We will probably finish the building aspect of the design and move to testing withini the next class period. This week we also had a challenge in which we were asked to create a paper boat that would float on water while also being able to hold weights. My group failed to meet the expectation but I learned that surface area is very important when it comes to making things float.

    <p>In our fourth week of engineering, we began to finish our projects and started to test them. My group took a long time to build and reinforce the project but after a lot of hard work and tape we finally completed the build. Our project popped the bloon after one small adjustment that was required and I was extrememly excitd because I was tired of our project taking so long. All in all I thouroughly enjoyed this project and found it very amusing and I built freindships with the kids in my group.</p>
    
    <p>The fifth week of class included the dissection of a chromebook as well as a lesson on electrical engineering. On Monday we had a special guest present us a slideshow all about how computers work and what electrical engineers do. On Wednesday and Friday we took apart an old chromebook and put them back together. My group was relatively good at this besides a few minor mistakes. We worked together well and did a good job witht the entire process. I found the project pretty funa and it was good bonding with my classmates.</p>
   
    <p>During week six we went into further depth of mechanical engineering and finished rebuilding our chromebook. After we completed our task, we had to start learning about more types of engineering and the teacher asked us which engineering field we would most likely pursue. I think I would want to go into architectural engineering or some sort of creation of buildings. I find intererst in these sort of complex ideas and I've always enjoyed building cities out of legos.</p>
   
    <p>Week seven of class included a lot of designing and researching. We were asked to research some biomechanical parts for different animals and create a design of something similar. I chose to create a prosthetic bird wing that was made a keratin and included built in solar panels to power the movements of it. At the end of the week we did a project on developing the steps of making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich to show that specification is very important in coding. I learned that a lot of people are very vague with their directions and don't make things very clear.</p>
   
    <p>For week eight we have gotten into the building of bottle rockets and have started to develop our designs. I am planning on making a very typical bottle rocket with four fins (one on each side) made out of cardboard which are attached to a 2 liter bottle of coke. On thursday, we did a project where we had to build a paper airplane and try to land it in a bucket from 2 stories up. I built a very flat airplane thinking it would be easiest to try and glide it across  the air and land it in the bucket but it just ended up doing a flip and getting stuck on a pillar. The experiment was still fun but it sucked I couldn't try it more than once.  </p>
