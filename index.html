        During my first week of engineering I had a lot of fun. I learned how to create my own website as well as many different coding options to specialize it. We did a team bonding activity where a few kids out of a group of about 20 had pipes and we all had to figure out how to work together to lead a marble through the pipes and into a bucket.

        As of my second week of engineering, I have learned plenty of safety precautions and the proper gear to be wearing when engineering. I've also learned about the website tinkercad and started a design on a Rube Goldberg machine. Our weekly challenge was to create an everyday household item on tinkercad using only basic shapes. I decided to do a vacuum cleaner and it turned out extremely well. I've made a few friends in this class and I enjoy the teaching style of my teacher. I can't wait to start building and designing actual projects.
