        During my first week of engineering I had a lot of fun. I learned how to create my own website as well as many different coding options to specialize it. We did a team bonding activity where a few kids out of a group of about 20 had pipes and we all had to figure out how to work together to lead a marble through the pipes and into a bucket.

        As of my second week of engineering, I have learned plenty of safety precautions and the proper gear to be wearing when engineering. I've also learned about the website tinkercad and started a design on a Rube Goldberg machine. Our weekly challenge was to create an everyday household item on tinkercad using only basic shapes. I decided to do a vacuum cleaner and it turned out extremely well. I've made a few friends in this class and I enjoy the teaching style of my teacher. I can't wait to start building and designing actual projects.

        For my third week of this class, we worked on developing our project and actually started to lay the foundation down on it. My group has finished most of the building of the design but there are still a few things required to be fully completed with the project. We will probably finish the building aspect of the design and move to testing withini the next class period. This week we also had a challenge in which we were asked to create a paper boat that would float on water while also being able to hold weights. My group failed to meet the expectation but I learned that surface area is very important when it comes to making things float.
